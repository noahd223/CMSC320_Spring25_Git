Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git helps keep track of changes in a project, making it easy to go back to previous versions or recover lost work. It also makes collaboration easier since multiple people can contribute without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes due to being able to fork a repository. With features like branching and merging, developers can test an idea separately before adding it to the main project. Finally, Git is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac machines, making it efficient to use across even a huge workplace.

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Data science could be applied to the field of Finance. For example, testing a certain portfolio strategy could require hypothesis testing and back testing of historical stock data to see if it would have any chance of working in the future.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging creates a new commit that combines the histories of both branches. Rebasing moves the entire branch to start from the latest commit of the target branch, applying each commit individually.

Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: I am looking forward to learning about the basics of machine learning and how data science and machine learning intersect. This will be useful for my other major (finance) and developing my skills in quantitative analysis.
