Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: Git helps keep track of changes in a project, making it easy to go back to previous versions or recover lost work. It also makes collaboration easier since multiple people can contribute without overwriting each otherâ€™s changes due to being able to fork a repository. With features like branching and merging, developers can test an idea separately before adding it to the main project. Finally, Git is compatible with Windows, Linux and Mac machines, making it efficient to use across even a huge workplace.
